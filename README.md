# AdamSpeechAPI
SpeechAPI with Language Recognition

Adam is a program created to take speech input from the user and reply with a response. The goal is for Adam to pass the turing test with a high rating. Adam will use
a manual approach rather than machine learning. 

The process is described as such : 
1. Adam will take speech input from the user.
2. Adam will search its set library for a response.
3. If Adam can not find a reasonable response, Adam will respond with "I'm not sure how to respond".
4. User will then input 3 different responses for Adam that fits the user's first conversation.
5. Each response will be categorized within 3 seperate categories. Common | Uncommon | Restricted
6. Adam will then save the responses for future conversations.
7. If Adam does respond to the user's conversation, then the user will grade the conversation. Grading the conversation is based on how "regular" the response is.
8. Once 100 conversations are completed the program will sort out the new data and save it to a previous resonse chart.
